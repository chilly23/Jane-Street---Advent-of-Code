# Jane Street Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Jane Street style Advent of Code problems, focused on algorithmic rigor, performance, and correctness rather than surface level scripting.

The problems span grid based simulations, range and interval reasoning, constraint driven elimination, and large scale input processing. Each solution emphasizes precise modeling, efficient data structures, vectorized computation where it adds value, and careful edge case handling. Problems are solved end to end, including input parsing, core logic, and validation against full sized datasets.

This work reflects how I approach hard quantitative and systems problems: reduce ambiguity, reason from first principles, and implement solutions that scale cleanly from toy examples to real constraints.

**Tech stack:** Python, NumPy  
**Focus areas:** performance, correctness, clarity, systems thinking
