# Jane Street Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to Jane Street’s Advent of Code style problems, focused on algorithmic rigor, performance, and correctness rather than surface level scripting.

The problems span grid based simulations, range processing, constraint driven elimination, and large scale input handling. Solutions emphasize clear modeling, efficient data structures, vectorized computation where applicable, and careful edge case handling. Several problems are solved end to end, including input parsing, core logic, and verification against real sized datasets. 
This work reflects how I approach hard systems and quantitative problems: reduce ambiguity, formalize the model, reason from first principles, and implement solutions that scale cleanly from toy examples to full inputs. <br><br><br>
